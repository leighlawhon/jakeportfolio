Hi! I’m Jacob. I am a self-taught programmer, optimization enthusiast, web developer, writer, student, and banana lover.

I’ve discovered my passion for the world of web development at an early age. The first thing I started coding was ROBLOX game, a platform where you can host and an engine and tools to make it easier to build games. I then started scripting. In 2020, I decided to start developing because I realized that game development required a lot of design elements that I was not interested in at the time.

As you will see in this the writing section of this portfolio, I write about web development quite a bit. A few years ago, I was able to meet an MIT professor, [Boris Katz](https://people.csail.mit.edu/boris/boris.html), who told me that, if I were to “continue programming, English is arguably equally important as the STEM part of development and many people don’t focus on it.” This encouraged me to get better at blogging and so I started writing my thoughts on coding.

I’m now looking for a software developer position to finally kick start my career.
