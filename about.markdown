Hi! I'm Jacob. I’ve discovered my passion for the world of web development at an early age. 
I am a self-taught programmer, optimization enthusiast, web developer, writer, student, and banana lover.
As you will see in this the writing section of this portfolio, I write about web development quite a bit. 
I’m now looking for a software developer position to finally kick start my career.
