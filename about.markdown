Hi! I'm Jacob. I am a self-taught programmer, optimization enthusiast, web developer, writer, student, and banana lover.

I’ve discovered my passion for the world of web development at an early age. The first thing I started coding was Roblocks game, a platform where you can host and an engine and tools to make it easier to build games. I  then sarted scripting. In 2020, I decided to start developing because I realized that game development had a lot of graphical and design elements that I was not interested in.

As you will see in this the writing section of this portfolio, I write about web development quite a bit. A few years ago I was able to meet an MIT profrssor, Boris Katz, who told me that, if I were to continue programming, englisg is arguably equally important as the STEM element part of it and many people don't focus on it. After about a year I started blogging and writing my thoughts on coding.

I started a developer advocate at Fuana contacted me because of a blog post I'd written.

I’m now looking for a software developer position to finally kick start my career.
