# Background
I was in a few Programer communities on Discord. At the time I was learning JavaScript and wanted a community that was restricted to that topic. I decided to create my own so that people like me could get support for JavaScript specifically.

I am the founder of the community and I manage the other admins for the community

I was building a bot for tasks for Discord

# Approach
My primary strategy for recruiting new members was to drive traffic to the community using SEO.

we were one of the first communities to switch over to Discord's new channels for communities.

# Results
Currently, there are more than 10K users in the community.

# Next Steps
In the future I am going to build a new bot, that uses Discords newer APIs to help make better tasks and events for JavaScripters
