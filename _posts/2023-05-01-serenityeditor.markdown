# Background
I was using Gammerly as a text editor. I wanted a text editor that was web native. A lot of native apps would not support Grammerly. I really wanted to work in markdown. Things like Google Docs are design more for office docs, and does not support markdown. so I would have to translate between formatted text and markdown.
